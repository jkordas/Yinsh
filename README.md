##Game description

YINSH is an abstract strategy board game by game designer Kris Burm. It is the fifth game to be released in the GIPF Project.

Short rules version: <br /> 
The players each start with 5 rings on the board. Every time a ring is moved, it leaves a marker behind.
Markers are white on one side and black on the other. When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped,
so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of 5 markers with their own color face up.
If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row.
The first player to remove 3 of his rings wins the game. In other words, each row you make brings you closer to 
victory-but also makes you weaker, because you have one less ring to play with. Very tricky!
